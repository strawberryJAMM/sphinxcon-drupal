/**
 * @file
 * Theme override of the socialmedia icon template
 *
 * This template is never used directly but, instead, is inherited by the templates
 * for each supported social media field.
 *
 * To use, put the following code at the top of the socialmedia link field template:
 *
 * {% extends "field--field-socialmedia-icon.html.twig" %}
 *
 *
 * Field:
 * This template assumes it is working with a LINK field that has been configured for 
 * a single item and to output the URL as text only. Inheriting templates can change 
 * this by modifying the "link_open" and "link_close" blocks appropriately.
 *
 *
 * Icon Font:
 * Bootstrap comes with the glyphicons icon font but, unfortunately, it does not 
 * include standard social media icons so this template assumes that the 8.x-2.x version  
 * Fontawesome module, which uses Fontawesome 5.0, has been installed 
 * (https://www.drupal.org/project/fontawesome) with it's settings configured to use 
 * the <span> tag.
 *
 * For an inheriting template to change the tag or use another icon font that is installed, 
 * it must override one or more of the "icon_tag","icon_font_id" and "icon_name_prefix"  
 * variables. The easiest way to do that, is to override the "icon" block, setting these 
 * variables appropriately followed by the parent block 
 *
 * E.g. To use the <i> tag instead of <span>, include the following clode in the inheriting
 * template: 
 *
 * {% block icon %} 
 *   {% set icon_tag = 'span' %}
 *   {{ parent() }}
 * {% endblock icon %}
 *
 * E.g. To switch to Glyphicons instead of Fontawesome, include the following code in the 
 * inheriting template: 
 *
 * {% block icon %} 
 *   {% set icon_font_id = 'glyphicon' %}
 *   {% set icon_name_prefix = 'glyphicon' %}
 *   {{ parent() }}
 * {% endblock icon %}
 *
 *
 * Icon:
 * This template uses the fontawesome 'twitter' brand icon by default. An inheriting  
 * template should set the value of the "icon_name" variable to the name of the icon to use. 
 * The easiest way to do that, is to override the "icon" block, setting this variable
 * appropriately followed by the parent block 
 *
 * E.g. to use the standard facebook icon, include the following code in the inheriting template:
 *
 * {% block icon %} 
 *   {% set icon_name = 'facebook' %}
 *   {{ parent() }}
 * {% endblock icon %}
 *
 * This template also assumes that a Fontawesome 5.0 "brand" icon is  being used, which 
 * require the "fab" font ID. For an inheriting template to use a non-brand icon the 
 * font ID must be overriden (with "fas", "far" or "fal", depending on the icon).
 *
 * E.g. To switch to the regular weight "at" symbol, include the following clode in the
 * inheriting template: 
 *
 * {% block icon %} 
 *   {% set icon_font_id = 'far' %}
 *   {% set icon_name = 'at' %}
 *   {{ parent() }}
 * {% endblock icon %}
 *
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 * - label_hidden: Whether to show the field label or not.
 * - title_attributes: HTML attributes for the title.
 * - label: The label for the field.
 * - multiple: TRUE if a field can contain multiple items.
 * - items: List of all the field items. Each item contains:
 *   - attributes: List of HTML attributes for each item.
 *   - content: The field item's content.
 * - entity_type: The entity type to which the field belongs.
 * - field_name: The name of the field.
 * - field_type: The type of the field.
 * - label_display: The display settings for the label.
